# timepy
Time stuffs

But seriously, print out the time in some timezones. 

## Requirements
- python 3.9-ish (likely 3.7+)
- pytz

## Running
`python src/timepy.py`

## Installation
`cp src/timepy.py <somewhere-in-your-path>/`
e.g. `cp src/timepy.py ~/bin/timepy`

## Notes 
### Time travel
"time has changed" and `pytz` depricated in python 3.10  (d'oh!)
